I am an Assistant Professor of Practice in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/) at the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/).
I received my Ph.D. from [University of North Texas](https://informationscience.unt.edu/).
Before that, I earned a Master's degree from [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/) and a Bachelor's degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science (CSS).
The primary goal is to make computers understand and facilitate better communications between people. My **research interests** involve:

- conversational behaviors and outcomes using computational, statistical, and corpus-based methods
- NLP applications for detecting and mitigating online incivility
- social support in the context of information behaviors
