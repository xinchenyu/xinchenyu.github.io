I am an Assistant Professor of Practice in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/) at the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/).
I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Information Science](https://informationscience.unt.edu/) at the University of North Texas.

My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science (CSS).
The primary goal of my research is to enable computers to understand human
conversations and capture early signals to proactively support wellbeing. 

I specifically focus on answering three core questions: 
- What are desired and undesired outcomes in human interactions? 
- What factors shape these outcomes? 
- Can we forecast undesired outcomes before they occur?
